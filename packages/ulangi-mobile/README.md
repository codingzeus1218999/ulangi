## Are you looking for docs? 
The docs for mobile app are hosted here: [https://ulangi.github.io/ulangi/mobile-app/](https://ulangi.github.io/ulangi/mobile-app/)

## Notes
All packages are installed locally (not from npm registry). Any changes to the local packages require you to reinstall them as symlink is not supported by react-native bundler yet.
```
npm run install-local
```
