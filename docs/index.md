# Ulangi Documentation
## Project management
We use **monorepo ([Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna))** to manage Ulangi project; that is, everything about Ulangi is hosted on a single repository. This makes it easy to reuse code across multiple platforms and to track related issues.

## Technology stack
- **React Native** for mobile app.
- **Electron** for desktop app *(to be developed)*.
