## Customizing Google Sheets Add-On
#### INTRODUCTION
Developing a *Google Sheets* add-on is quite tricky because we cannot reuse code from other packages. The only thing we can reuse is typings from *ulangi-common*. For this reason, this add-on should provide only basic functionalities.

#### Involved packages:
- [ulangi-google-sheets](https://github.com/ulangi/ulangi/tree/master/packages/ulangi-google-sheets)
- [ulangi-common](https://github.com/ulangi/ulangi/tree/master/packages/ulangi-common)
